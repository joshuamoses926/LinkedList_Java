# LinkedList_Java

The program will ask for the name of a text file.  It will then read the file and keep track each of the words in the file, the number of times it occurs, and which line numbers contain the word.  If a word occurs more than once in a line, count it more than once but do not duplicate the line number.  Words in the document are separated by spaces and punctuation, which are the following: ? , . !;:-.  That is, question mark, period, comma, exclamation point, semicolon, colon, and hyphen.  Ignore parentheses and quotation marks.  Contractions such as “don’t” are considered a single word.  Your test data will not contain numbers.  It may contain blank lines, which count in the line numbering but which, containing no words, are ignored.  Plurals and variations of a word are considered different.  Ignore capitalization; Word and word are the same.  Your program will exit after printing the output.
